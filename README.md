# Email-Validation

#Introduction:-
 Email Validation is a project in which we check all the condition while making new mail id.If our enterd id is wrong then it shows an wrong email id with specified conditions. This project is usefull to find what is wrong with enterd id while making new one.
 
#Used Function:- 
 In this project i simply used if,else and elif conditions to check standard conditions of Mail id.In that i used the following types of methods
 1.isalpha()-To check the starting of id with alphabetical letters or not.
 2.count():- To check number of count of @ symball.
 3.XOR Operator:- To check if anyone condition is true then output will be shown.
 4.isspace():-To check space between the letter or not.
 5.upper():- To check all letters is in small case.
 6.isdigit():-To check Numerical digit is allow in it.
 
#Working:-
 At first by using if else condition we check that the enterd mail id should have minimum six digits of number.Further that we check starting of mail id should with   alphabetical letters.Then further i give condition to check @ symball is used in single time.Further that we check dot(.) is used at the specified index number or not by using XOR operator. After that we check all letters in id should in lowercase letter.further we check using iteration on string that no empty space is allow while creating new id.  
 
#Conclusion:-
 When you run the program everytime they ask for user defined input.After entering input it checks that where your enterd email id is wrong and it shows wrong email.If not no comment will be shown there.
